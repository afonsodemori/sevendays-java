# 7 Days Of Code: Java

**[7DaysOfCode.io](https://7daysofcode.io)** is a webpage maintained by [Alura](https://www.alura.com.br) — a Brazilian
Technology School — with a set of code challenges divided by technology (languages, frameworks, tools, etc.) so the
students can put in practice their knowledge solving 7 challenges, one per day, in the technology they're learning.

**This repository is for the Java challenges.** Learn more and subscribe at https://7daysofcode.io/matricula/java

On the first day, you will make your Java code consume the IMDB API, fetch the top 250 movies from their list and print
the corresponding JSON in the console.
